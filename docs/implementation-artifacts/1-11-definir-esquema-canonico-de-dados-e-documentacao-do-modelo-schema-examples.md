# Story 1.11: Definir esquema canônico de dados e documentação do modelo (schema + examples)

Status: ready-for-dev

## Story

As a Data Engineer / Tech Writer,
I want a canonical schema for stored CSV snapshots and a documented example file,
so that downstream consumers (notebooks, metrics) have a stable contract.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A `docs/schema.yaml` defines column names, types, nullable flags and semantic notes.
- An example CSV `dados/examples/ticker_example.csv` is included and referenced by `docs/schema.md` explaining column meanings and versioning strategy.
- Migration notes for schema changes are documented (minor vs breaking changes) and versioned using `schema_version` in snapshot metadata.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Create `docs/schema.yaml` with canonical column definitions and `schema_version: 1`.
- [ ] Add `docs/schema.md` describing the schema, versioning policy and migration guidance.
- [ ] Add example CSV `dados/examples/ticker_example.csv` with representative rows and header.
- [ ] Add unit test `tests/test_schema.py` to validate `dados/examples/ticker_example.csv` against `docs/schema.yaml` using `pandera` or lightweight validator.
- [ ] Reference schema in `docs/implementation-artifacts/1-1-implementar-interface-de-adapter-e-adaptador-yfinance-minimo.md` and adapter mappings.
- [ ] Update `docs/implementation-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml` status for this story to `ready-for-dev` (persisted).

## Dev Notes

- Canonical columns (recommended): `ticker, date, open, high, low, close, adj_close, volume, source, fetched_at, raw_checksum`.
- `date` should be ISO date (`YYYY-MM-DD`) stored as text in SQLite; `fetched_at` as UTC ISO8601 datetime.
- `raw_checksum` is SHA256 hex of raw provider payload or CSV for auditability.
- Use `schema_version` in snapshot metadata and in the header of `docs/schema.yaml` for migration tracking.
- Validation: recommend `pandera` for DataFrame validation in the mapper stage; provide a simple YAML-driven validator for CI tests.

### File Structure Notes

- `docs/schema.yaml` — canonical schema definition and semantic notes.
- `docs/schema.md` — human-friendly explanation, migration policy and examples.
- `dados/examples/ticker_example.csv` — example CSV referenced by docs and tests.

### Testing Requirements

- Unit tests to assert example CSV validates against `docs/schema.yaml`.
- CI job should include a lightweight validation step that loads `docs/schema.yaml` and validates snapshots produced in tests.
