# Story 0.8: playbooks-quickstart-e-ux-minimal

Status: ready-for-dev

## Story

As a Tech Writer / UX,
I want quickstart and UX minimal playbooks,
so that users can follow step-by-step instructions to reproduce experiments and get help when things fail.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `docs/playbooks/quickstart-ticker.md` exists with step-by-step commands, expected outputs and troubleshooting tips.
2. `docs/playbooks/ux.md` includes quick user guidance and recommended examples for onboarding.
3. README links to the playbooks.

## Tasks
- [ ] Create `docs/playbooks/quickstart-ticker.md` with commands and verification steps.
- [ ] Create `docs/playbooks/ux.md` with onboarding tips and examples.
- [ ] Add sample CSV and expected checksum example to `docs/samples/`.

## Dev Notes
- Keep content concise and action-oriented; include exact commands and example tickers.
- Include section 'If quickstart fails' with steps to collect logs and re-run.
